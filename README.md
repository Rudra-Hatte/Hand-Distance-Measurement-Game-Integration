# 🤚 Hand Distance Measurement & Game Integration

A Python project that uses a normal webcam to measure the distance between hands in real-time, using OpenCV and YOLO for hand tracking. This measurement is integrated into an interactive game controlled dynamically by the user's hand movements.

---

## 📌 Features

- Real-time hand detection using YOLO and OpenCV
- Measures distance between hands accurately using computer vision techniques
- Integrates hand distance as input to control an interactive game
- Works with a normal webcam — no special hardware needed
- Uses genetic algorithms to optimize game parameters and enhance control responsiveness
- Embedded systems integration (optional, depending on hardware)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- Genetic Algorithms
- Embedded Systems (for game integration and hardware control)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-distance-game.git
cd hand-distance-game
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Your webcam will activate, and you can start measuring hand distances in real-time and interact with the game.
